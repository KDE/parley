for KLatin: all the following you suggested before would be good.
libkeduvocio    : - loading, saving in xml and plugin support for
                      other file formats.
                     - API for accessing the words and properties
libkeduvocpart  : kpart to display the words.
                     - display table as in kvoctrain
                     - display flip cards as in flashkard
libkeduvocedit  : edit dialog to enter/modify the properties
libkeduvocquery : standard query and settings dialogs
libkeduvocsettings : standard settings dialogs
Names of the libs may vary of course.

Sounds: when KDE has ogg support, sounds will not be a problem. I mean that 
sound is just 2 lines code. The problems with sounds is to find people that 
will record them. Recorded sounds should be in the corresponding i18n package 
and in the app. 
Like in KLatin, if it uses sound (associated with a flashkard for example) 
the front of the kard might be "puella": latin sound included in the app
and the back of the kard will be girl, fille, etc.. included in each i18n 
package.

Support for different languages: the lib should allow i18n. I had 2 different 
answers about translating data from i18n people. The rigorous approach is 
that everything should go through the pot file and thus we need scripts to 
get the data from xml files to a dummy cpp file with i18n() functions.
The less rigorous approach would allow translators to work on the xml files 
like they do with docbook. This has to be defined with i18n. 

Pics: pic support for the front of the flashkard. A flashkard could be either 
a word one or a pic one: pic of a girl->puella for KLatin.
That would allow reading help for children and learning new vocabulary.

Hope that helps,

annma

PS: for KTimes, the app will be rewritten. Scott suggested the idea of 
flashkard for multiplication tables, of course, it is very good (should have 
thought of it myself ;). 
How will the xml be done in that case?
Again, choice of flashkard with pics and without pics. For learning and 
testing.
