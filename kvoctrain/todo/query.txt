yes, hard choice :-) originally I chose "tagged" for the other one because 
the user "tags" manually and "selected" was because the user "selected" it 
for his query.

"isInQuery/setInQuery" indicates what's really happening.

Yes, I know. It's even worse on slow machines. Currently the dialog is new'd 
and delete'd every time. Faster and not flickering should it be just to 
update the dialog. This way the second topic above could also be solved 
better.
