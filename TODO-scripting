TODO to get scripting into Parley
=============================

 * Make KPluginSelector save its settings (which plugin is enabled/disabled)
 * On Parley startup load the enabled scripts
 * Connect with signal/slot the script and the editing of vocabulary
 * Expose some functions that will allow the script to add translations
 * Make the translations visible to the user in a nice way.

 * Read up on kross

 * Define which part of the api will be exposed for scripts
   - Do we need an extra layer or can it be integrated directly?
   - Can we pass around complex stuff like KEduVocExpression or does that need a wrapper?
   - How can scripts fill out for example the conjugations for a verb?

 * Integrate with KNewStuff2

 * How are scripts/plugins recognized? Probably using .desktop files. Investigate how other apps are doing this.

 * Write some example scripts to validate the implementation
   - Possible scripts:
     + dict.someserver
     + conjugations for spanish (http://turingmachine.org/compjugador/)
     + script: fetchTranslation("word")


 * Maybe try to use python and ruby to check that both are working?
   - Frederik volunteers for one py script :)


 * Scripts can make use of kde bindings, so they can have a gui. If we deliver some by default, they could even be translated. If there is still time, look into that.

 * Scripts (for discussion)
    + define script api
    + scripts adding actions to menu
    + script manager (amarok 1.4.x from distro packages)
