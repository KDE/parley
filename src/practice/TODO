TODO Practice
-------------

Planning:

 * Define which elements a theme has to contain, optional ones
 * How do we realize layout
   - What needs to be included in the main UI? How can we simplify the UI?

 * Theme elements
    - What should be themeable? Do we need any invariant elements?
 * Define interaction with parley
    - How will parleypractice be spawned?
    - How much abstraction should be between them?

Doing (in no particular order):
 * Finish the settings dialogs
 * Make parleypractice honor its settings
 * Create the statistical summary dialog
 * Recreate various practice modes
 * Create new practice modes
 * KNS / themes download

Bugs:
* Filter (sometimes)) doesn't filter blank entries
* The % correct bar borks if you get the first question wrong
