Elements that are part of an active area should be prefixed with the area name and _ (eg written_answer_text_box)
Elements are are NOT part of an active area (ie they are part of the main group) should be prefixed with main_ (eg main_progress_bar).

Any of these can be visible or invisible.
Note on terminology: 'solution' is the correct response. 'answer' is anything the user inputs, and it may or may not match the solution.

Optional:
progress_bar # this element will be scaled in proportion to bar_background to show progress. Note: if existant, it must be visible.
progress_bar_background # this element will determine how the bar in scaled. At 100% progress, bar will cover the same area as bar_background
feedback_box # A feedback sentence is placed here (telling the user if it is correct and hints if it is wrong, etc). This is highly reccomended in a theme.

Optional UI elements: (If these do not exist, they are still available from the menus)
continue_button # a button that toggles between displaying 'check answer' and 'continue' is placed here.

Note: These can be turned off in settings; if they are, the buttons won't be shown (ie, make them invisible or it will look wierd)
skip_known_button # show a button to skip to the next question while signalling you know the solution
skip_unknown_button # show a button to skip to the next question while signally you don't know the solution
hint_button # show a button to give a hint.
show_solution_button # shows the solution and counts the question as incorrectly answered (See flashcard for exception)

Timers: Implement either 0 or 1 of these:
timer_progress_box # A timer is shown as an embedded QProgressBar.
timer_digital_clock # A timer is shown as a number in an embedded widget.
timer_bar / timer_bar_background # A timer is shown as a progress bar (counting down).
timer_clock # A timer is shown as a graphical clock of some sort.


Sound & Images:
image_box and sound_box can be added to any mode, but be aware they are not neccessarily common and can be disabled; don't make the existence of an image integral to your UI design.

If an active_area exists with a name that is suffixed by _image (eg written_image, elements become written_image_question_text_box), that layout will be used for questions with images assosiated. If such an area does not exist, the normal area will always be used.


Elements required (sorted by mode required):

Written:
Example:
Paraphrase:
answer_text_box # the text input widget will be placed here
question_text_box # the question text will be placed here, vertically centered

Flashcard:
flashcard_text_box # where to put the text on the flashcard (both the question and solution can be put here)
show_solution_button # On this one it shows the solution, but doesn't automatically count it as wrong. Also, it is non-optional for this mode.
known_button # this indicates you know the solution
unknown_button # this indicates you didn't know the solution

Multiple Choice:
Article:
Antonym:
Synonym:
question_text_box
answer_mc_box # this holds the multiple choice widget. Note: up to 9 choices are allowed, and 5 is default, so this has to be fairly large.

Mixed Letters:
question_mixed_letters_box # This box holds the mixed up letters. Note: Make this reasonably large.
question_text_box
answer_text_box

Comparison:
absolute_box
comparative_box
superlative_box

Conjugation:
question_text_box_infinitive # used for the infinitive label (It will just say "Infinitive")
answer_text_box_infinitive # line edit to enter the infinitive

# These are all used to prompt for various conjugation tenses
# make the question_text_boxes fairly long; a significant amount of text may be placed there
# The answer_text_boxes can be fairly short
# For example, infinitive_question_text_box would say "Infinitive"
# infinitive_answer_text_box would say "to be" (even though this is a line edit, it would be prepopulated)
# question_text_box_1 would say "First-person plural present"
# answer_text_box_1 would want "are"
answer_text_box_1
question_text_box_1

answer_text_box_2
question_text_box_2

answer_text_box_2
question_text_box_2



Main background name: main, with element active_area that active areas (below) are placed in.

Active areas are the parts of the practice that change depending on the mode. For the modes with defaults listed,
if you do not provide an area for that mode, it will default to the listed mode.

To create an active area, make a rectangle the same size as the 'active_area' element and name it 'modename_box'. Add all the other elements on top of it,
and then group them and name the group 'modename'.
