                     Things to improve in parley
                     ---------------------------


================================================================
Before the 14.12 release (bugs).

NOTE:  DO NOT CHANGE THESE IN MASTER.
       Instead, change them in the branch and merge the branch into master.

 * To investigate
    + Show pronounciation in the training				----
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150923
      This can be extended for other fields like
      comments, too.
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175241
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238893
    + Impossible to remove images					----
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=263836
    + Vocabulary does not expire after a given time			----
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=261396

 * All crashes
    + Parley crash while adding choice in multiple			----
      choice mode in editor (investigate)
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255647
    + Scripts need to sandboxed or atleast check			----
      if data can be fetched and stop gracefully. Eg:
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252696

 * Data loss
    + ...

 * Misfeatures
    + Make it possible to click anywhere in a collection widget		----
      in the dashboard.
    + Unify color handling in the dashboard				----
       - Add a color for pregrades
    + Make the number of collections per line dynamic, depending	----
      on how wide the window is.

 * Normal bugzilla bugs
    + Vocabulary does not expire                                        ----
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=261396
    + Synonyms are not checked case-insensitively                       ----
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=302733

 * Usability
    + ...

 * Bugs without a bugzilla bug
    + When the dashboard is updated with F5 and goes from 0 words due	Done
      to >0 then the text is still "practice anyway".

      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=273040
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238893

 * Merge Amarvir's GSoC							----


================================================================
Release work for 14.12


 * Change the version number of Parley (2.0?)				----
 * Create new versions in Bugzilla					----
 * Add the new features to the feature plan				----
 * Blog        		       	       					----


================================================================
                            Open issues


 OVERALL GOAL:
   Make the program more focussed around the learning process.
   Learning is the purpose of the program. All other functions are
   just to support that purpose.


 * General
    + ...

 * Usability
    + Disable those practice modes in the GUI that are not supported    ----
      by the data in the selected lessons. This would be better than
      having all of them enabled and popping up a big warning dialog
      when the user starts the practice.
    + Bigger default font for practice contents                         ----
    + Profiles so that you can switch between different sets of units	----
      quickly
      https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252482

 * Practice
    + ...

 * Editor
    + Drag & drop of images from other applications                     ----
    + Select whole regions of a table so that you can cut&paste them    ----
      into another parley or something else. Also support paste into
      lessons of a group of words.
    + Smaller issues                                                    ----
       - Button to remove all empty lines.                              ----
       - Button (menu entry) to check for duplicates                    ----
    + Always keep the primary (to be learned) language visible?

 * File formats
    + (Big) New container format with kvtml and all the                 ----
      images/sounds/whatever.  This should be modeled after ODF files
      and use a zip container, manifest, etc.  Lots of code for this
      in Calligra.
    + Enhancements in KVTML
       - Allow one image for a whole entry, not just for a word.        ----
         After all, all the translations in an entry mean the same thing.
       - Field for transcription of non-western scripts                 ----

================================================================

Below is old stuff, most of which is outdated (refers to KDE 4.1!).
We will move appropriate issues up to the current ones above.

================================================================

Before releases:
 * Check that changes to the document result in a modified state!!!!
   Ask when quitting Parley!!!
 * Reenable synonym, false friend and antonym practices and synonym
   check in written practice! check if deletion of one of two synonyms
   crashes

When time permits:
 * update the dtd and validate some documents
 * write more unit tests
 * Add the ability to record sound files with phonon to a dock if
   possible. This depends on the state of Phonon - might be ready for
   4.1.
 * Use the container/lesson class for the leitner implementation
 * Drag and drop for several things:
   - Sound
   - Accept text drops (as new vocabulary?)

Gui
 * shortcut keys are badly assigned, they do not respect the focus
   (pressing del when a lesson was selected will attempt to delete a
   word anyways)
 * Image file open dialog: filter and preview. Maybe restrict to image files?
 * Sound file open dialog: filter and preview
 * Navigation (editing vocabulary).
   act as usual spreadsheet application. (especially useful if trying to edit more than 2 columns).
     Enter       -> move down.
     Shift+Enter -> move up.
     Tab         -> move right.
     Shift+Tab   -> move left.
 * Improve the search somehow to let the user continue typing instead
   of blocking (also not trivial?) - somewhat improved by performance
   gain - still desireable?
 * Enable the active field again? If the active field stays, use checkboxes
 * For some languages (with signs like chinese) it would be nice to
   have different font sizes in the columns
 * Validator/correction of user answers
 * Separators need to be implemented with the new corrector
   class. Possibly giving the user the chance to add more words when
   entering right answers but not all of them.
 * Analysis of sentences could be improved a lot

General
 * Warn about overwriting kvtml-1 files

 * declination support
   - the gui (dock widget) needs lots of polishing
   - implement configuration for grammatical cases in language dialog

 * articles are only singular so far
   - reader and writer
   - gui has to be extended

 * adjectives can have a gender and plural
 * tenses - make it possible to change their order and redo the dialog in general
 * Undo - KUndoStack

Pronunciation
 * option to display it along in the practice dialogs
 * is a pronunciation practice desirable? maybe together with sound
   (write after listening) also very much for chinese I'm told.
