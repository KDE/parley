Things to improve in parley
---------------------------

Before 4.1 release:
 * Make all dock widgets work
   - creating a new doc does not create any word types
 * Save columns hide state, enable hiding of main columns with their children maybe
 * The statistics page is broken. Time for a rewrite.
 * Remove ModelTest!
 * Copy/Paste and friends.
 * What about editing multiple entries at the same time? does that work? does it help with the new design?
 * Check that changes to the document result in a modified state!!!! Ask when quitting Parley!!!


 * Implement more online lookup possiblities, language dependent. (or remove this - depends on soc) 


When time permits:
 * update the dtd and validate some documents
 * write more unit tests

 * Add the ability to record sound files with phonon to a dock if possible. This depends on the state of Phonon - might be ready for 4.1.
 * Use the container/lesson class for the leitner implementation
 * Drag and drop for several things:
   - Sound
   - Accept text drops (as new vocabulary?)
 * Give containers an image tag and display images in the lesson view
 * Check for mem leaks - I bet I introduced some in the lib.

Gui
 * shortcut keys are badly assigned, they do not respect the focus
 * Image file open dialog: filter and preview. Maybe restrict to image files?
 * Sound file open dialog: filter and preview
 * Navigation (editing vocabulary).
   act as usual spreadsheet application. (especially useful if trying to edit more than 2 columns).
     Enter       -> move down.
     Shift+Enter -> move up.
     Tab         -> move right.
     Shift+Tab   -> move left.
 * When clicking on "Restore native order" arrow in column header remains.
   It should become hidden now.
 * Improve the search somehow to let the user continue typing instead of blocking (also not trivial?)
 * Enable the active field again? If the active field stays, use checkboxes
 * For some languages (with signs like chinese) it would be nice to have different font sizes in the columns
Validator/correction of user answers
 * Seperators need to be implemented with the new corrector class. Possibly giving the user the chance to add more words when entering right answers but not all of them.
 * Analysis of sentences could be improved a lot

  maybe: * KOffice has fancy hide docker buttons in their docker titles, steal them ;)

General
 * Open/Create file - maybe it makes sense to open/create file in new
   application window, and keep "current" document opened?
 * Warn about overwriting kvtml-1 files

 * declination support
   - a class is there
   - reader and writer
   - gui

 * articles are only singular so far
   - reader and writer
   - gui has to be extended

 * adjectives can have a gender and plural
 * tenses - make it possible to change their order and redo the dialog in general
 * Undo - KUndoStack

Pronunciation
 * option to display it along in the practice dialogs
 * is a pronunciation practice desireable? maybe together with sound (write after listening) also very much for chinese I'm told.
