Things to improve in parley
---------------------------

**BUGS**
 * When sorting columns the entry numbers sometimes are not updated. Either hide the number column (do we need it anyways? or fix that)

Gui
 * shortcut keys are badly assigned, they do not respect the focus
 * Image file open dialog: filter and preview. Maybe restrict to image files?
 * Sound file open dialog: filter and preview
 * Editing of vocabulary should be made easier
 * Default windows size bigger (eg 800x525)
 * Navigation (editing vocabulary).
   act as usual spreadsheet application. (especially useful if trying to edit more than 2 columns).
     Enter       -> move down.
     Shift+Enter -> move up.
     Tab         -> move right.
     Shift+Tab   -> move left.
 * When clicking on "Restore native order" arrow in column header remains.
   It should become hidden now.
 * Entry number column - clicking on it should maybe sort entries by
   their numbers, not select all entries. (This was tricky somehow, though I don't remember why)
 * Ctrl+F shortcut for search
 * Improve the search somehow to let the user continue typing instead of blocking (also not trivial?)
 * If the active field stays, it would be easier to use checkboxes
 * Model/view for the main table: include other fields and be more flexible
 * Different icons for Lesson-Select/Add/Deselect/Delete (right click menu)

Validator/correction of user answers
 * Seperators need to be implemented with the new corrector class. Possibly giving the user the chance to add more words when entering right answers but not all of them.
 * Analysis of sentences could be improved a lot

General
 * Open/Create file - maybe it makes sense to open/create file in new
   application window, and keep "current" document opened?
 * Warn about overwriting kvtml-1 files

 * declination support
   - a class is there
   - reader and writer
   - gui

 * articles are only singular so far
   - reader and writer
   - gui has to be extended

Pronunciation
 * research how entering that could be made easier
 * option to display it along in the practice dialogs
 * is a pronunciation practice desireable? maybe together with sound (write after listening)
