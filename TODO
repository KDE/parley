Things to improve in parley
---------------------------

Gui
 * shortcut keys are badly assigned, they do not respect the focus
 * Image file open dialog: filter and preview. Maybe restrict to image files?
 * Sound file open dialog: filter and preview
 * Editing of vocabulary should be made easier

Validator/correction of user answers
 * Seperators need to be implemented with the new corrector class. Possibly giving the user the chance to add more words when entering right answers but not all of them.
 * Analysis of sentences could be improved a lot

General
 * declination support
   - a class is there
   - reader and writer
   - gui

 * articles are only singular so far
   - reader and writer
   - gui has to be extended

Pronunciation
 * research how entering that could be made easier
 * option to display it along in the practice dialogs
 * is a pronunciation practice desireable? maybe together with sound (write after listening)
