Things to improve in parley
---------------------------

Gui
 * shortcut keys are badly assigned, they do not respect the focus

General
 * declination support
   - a class is there
   - reader and writer
   - gui

 * articles are only singular so far
   - reader and writer
   - gui has to be extended

Pronunciation
 * research how entering that could be made easier
 * option to display it along in the practice dialogs
 * is a pronunciation practice desireable? maybe together with sound (write after listening)
