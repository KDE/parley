-------------------
 DO IT:
-------------------

QUERY:
Check all query dialogs so that they work properly. Yes - for me normal type in query crashes right now. Could it be, that only the current lesson is querried?

When renaming a lesson, the main table is not updated.

Just noticed: we have what's this - need to add hints!!

Search:
-the sorting reverses again. change it to ascending or so...
<peter> I have now implemented a slot that restores the native order. Please review.

-maybe it's a bit more efficient without all this reset() ? But I don't know a better way at the moment. Is there a filter->updateSomething()??
<peter> Yes, we should try to get rid of all resets, as they clear the selection. filterChanged() and clear() seem to do the job most of the time, but I'm still figuring out how they work.

When opening a doc with $kvoctrain doc.kvtml, it fails and in recent appears doc.kvtml instead of /home/xy/doc.kvtml. -- now works, but is only added to recent files if a full path is given.

Pressing delete after selecting a lesson wants to delete vocabs, not the lesson.

Default lesson comes into existence sometimes... why? (When deleting a lesson). Also when inserting a new vocabulary.

kvoctrain: KVocTrainApp::slotCreateRandom() needs to be redone - Frederik said he'd do that. Switch to new lesson stuff. Maybe add this to right click menu - split into sublessons. (Remember, we have no vocabulary without lesson!). So "New lesson" becomes "New lesson 01", "New lesson 02", ...

--------------------
 NOT SO FAR FUTURE:
--------------------

Lesson list:
-focus via qwidget->setFocus() ??? sometimes a dotted frame is shown upon startup, which does not correspond with the selection.
-I'd like to show the current lesson but someone scrolls it away (maybe the focus?)
-count of entries in the lesson could be nice

Library: Add functions: addLesson, removeLesson. Eventually also something to change the order of lessons.

m_tableView and friends: make columns visible/hide as user wishes. Additional columns for word type and all that seems sensible(?).

Combobox: make it editable with regexp or better space as seperator to search-select lessons
kvttablemodel: make columns hideable, add support for more columns like word type. By default only show original + translations. Are the numbers of the entries significant to the user? maybe better hide them?

Enable drag and drop for lessons and vocab (drag into lesson, change order of lessons).

Icons and artwork seems rather old... maybe ask those oxygen guys? annma said she'll ask for a new icon.

Allow sorting: is it still necessary? If we have a undo sort function? Otherwise document it.

There is some interesting stuff on config dialogs on
http://wiki.openusability.org/guidelines/index.php/Practical_Examples:Configuration_Dialogs
Maybe it would be cool to have the colors like they do there - in a list view.

<peter>Possibly, but they don't show what happens behind the Edit button, and since color is the only property we change I think we are OK.

Configure->View Settings: IPA font could be changed into something meaningfull. (What does it stand for???)

<peter>IPA = International Phonetic Association or International Phonetic Alphabet. This allows you to specify a special font for phonetic display of pronunciation. I have added some tooltips/whatsthis

In query: make an option to show current lesson, when questioning.

Creating a new document is still hell. Maybe for now we could just ask for two languages which covers probably about 99% of the cases, the others will then find their way to add another...

------------------
 LONG TERM STUFF:
------------------

Tabs or buttons to switch from normal view to query option page (all on one page - this has to be possible. maybe still some special advanced options in the menu, but one page with sane defaults. Maybe a button on it to allow adjusting timeouts for threshholds.) From this page it should be possible to directly start a query.

rename query to test, practice whatever ???

Welcome screen with options: New file (wizzard?), manage old and query/test
AND/OR: Tabs in Main Window allowing allowing a quick switch between table and query option page (which can start the query)

More test possibilities? Like plugins?
-Letter mixup like on www.ponsline.de ->vocab trainer

Make the query/test look better!?! Colorfull? Nice?

Statistics/after test screen? Number of words with status xyz? "Hey, you got 33,33 % right the first time, cool!"?
Also maybe (if desired) a list of words that are especially bad... As to say, hey - these are your problems.

maybe some article handling? I find that I often have the word right but with wrong article. Then it says false and sometimes I change my word, which was right. So a hint like, "great, but wrong article" would sometimes be cool.

Synonyms how??????

One thing, I always wondered about, is how the rating is done/changed. Maybe this could be documented? Even configured? Is it different if I get a word right in multiple choice or type it?
In query there is this percentage bar...?

Ok, we have the lessons - that's sort of a natural hierachy. Why not use it? In the end, much stuff might be easier, if lessons actually had a list of their entries. Also parsing the xml should almost do this... But because of the way it's defined it doesn't. Would be better do have something like 
<lesson "My lesson">
	<"entries here">
</lesson>
Can we redefine the xml? Maybe write a little conversion tool, to make the old stuff work? This way maybe lessons don't need a number any more... I have too many +1 in there because everything starts counting at 0, but I need to start lesson names at 1 because 0 is reserved for no lesson, which does not exist any more.
Makes me wonder if it would be ok to return -1 as index, if no lesson is set and simply use the 0 to make everything more consistent???
Also attributes are a little abused. Maybe we could reduce them a little? What do other apps find crappy about the format? Does anyone use it this intensive?
I want kvtml version 2 !?!

<peter>So do I, but maybe for slightly different reasons.

I also don't think the original-trans1-trans2 thing is great. Original should not need a special treatment. (Why should it). So either to make it politically correct call them identifier 1..n or language 1..n, because language is easier to remember.

<peter>See https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93446 for why this might not be such a good idea.
Frederik: I see. Well, when thinking about a new xml structure, this could be taken into account. I'd still like to do it somehow. This has to be done careful anyway.

<lesson "My test">
	<entry>
		<lang "en">to go</lang>
		<lang "de">gehen</lang>
		<lang "es">ir</lang>
		<type>verb</type>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<lang "en">entry</lang>
		<lang "es">la entrada</lang>
		<type>noun</type>
	</entry>


</lesson>



Sublessons. One day ;) (no problem doing <lesson "Top"><lesson "Sub 1"> <entries> </lesson></lesson>

get new vocabulary online skripts? for example from leo.org? (I enter abc, a list of translations appears?)

------------
 SOLVED:
------------

What happens in the unlikely (and stupid) but possible event, that the user deletes the last lesson that exists? Do we pop up with a new Default lesson? Ha, cannot happen - the last vocabulary cannot be deleted. Great!

Save splitter position, maybe set a more sensible default for it???? -- DONE Thanks a lot Peter! I never did anything with KConfigXT so that's great.

Get rid of Qt/kde 3 stuff:
[21:46:28] <pinotree> common-dialogs/thresholdoptionsbase.ui:      <widget class="Q3ListBox" name="lessonlist" > -- DELETED
[21:46:52] <pinotree> common-dialogs/pasteoptionsbase.ui:       <widget class="Q3ListBox" name="OrderList" >  -- DELETED

<peter> both of those will go away in the near future.  -- DONE

Move Merge to the library so both KVT and KWQ can use it. -- DONE

Be able to configure directory for New Stuff downloads -- DONE

Crash when close -> cancel (I think it does not happen any more(?)) -- DONE

Get rid of copy/paste order stuff.  -- DONE

Review the configuration dialog -- DONE

DONE ? Crash when close -> cancel (I think it does not happen any more(?)) -- DONE

Right click stuff: delete for lessons -Frederik -- DONE 

Throw out m_currentLesson - this will be handled only in m_doc->currentLesson(). -Frederik -- DONE

If I add a new entry it is not displayed in the table!!!!!!!!!
What happens if current lesson is not in query, but I want to add to it? Switch combo state for now. -Frederik -- DONE

All Lessons related stuff now gone from the Configuration dialog. Lessons in query, etc. now has to be handled through the new interface. -- DONE

Inserting new vocab does not insert it into the currently selected lesson. Maybe we could also just change to this lesson, if Edit query is selected in the combo - otherwise the new entry is not displayed. That is frustrating. -- DONE

Right click -> all/none select does not update table (when combo = query). -- DONE
