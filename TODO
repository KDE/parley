-------------------
 DO IT:
-------------------
Need to correctly preselect the lesson in main table as well!

Right click stuff? Rename, new, delete? for lessons

Save splitter position, maybe set a more sensible default for it????

focus via qwidget->setFocus() ???

Crash when close -> cancel

If I add a new entry it is not displayed in the table!!!!!!!!!
->reload !?!
What happens if current lesson is not in query, but I want to add to it?

Just noticed: we have what's this - need to add hints!!

--------------------
 NOT SO FAR FUTURE:
--------------------

I'd like to show the current lesson but someone scrolls it away (maybe the focus?)

Library: Add functions: addLesson, removeLesson, reorderLesson (?)

m_tableView and friends: make columns visible/hide as user wishes. Additional columns for word type and all that seems sensible(?).

Combobox: make it editable with regexp or better space as seperator to search-select lessons
kvttablemodel: make columns hideable, add support for more columns like word type. By default only show original + translations. Are the numbers of the entries significant to the user? maybe better hide them?

Enable drag and drop for lessons and vocab (drag into lesson, change order of lessons).

What happens in the unlikely (and stupid) but possible event, that the user deletes the last lesson that exists? Do we pop up with a new Default lesson?

Icons and artwork seems rather old... maybe ask those oxygen guys?

Allow sorting: is it still necessary? If we have a undo sort function? Otherwise document it.

------------------
 LONG TERM STUFF:
------------------

Tabs or buttons to switch from normal view to query option page (all on one page - this has to be possible. maybe still some special advanced options in the menu, but one page with sane defaults. Maybe a button on it to allow adjusting timeouts for threshholds.) From this page it should be possible to directly start a query.

rename query to test, practice whatever

Welcome screen with options: New file (wizzard?), manage old and query/test
AND/OR: Tabs in Main Window allowing allowing a quick switch between table and query option page (which can start the query)

Synonyms how??????

More test possibilities? Like plugins?
-Letter mixup like on ponsline

Make the query/test look better!?! Colorfull? Nice?

Statistics/after test screen? Number of words with status xyz? "Hey, you got 33,33 % right the first time, cool!"?
