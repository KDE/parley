Things to improve in parley
---------------------------

**In this branch: **
 * Make all dock widget work
 * Add the docks to the menu bar
   - what about special types that have extra attributes like conjugations etc?
     - create a context menu to set a word type to contain nouns etc
 * KOffice has fancy hide docker buttons in their docker titles, steal them ;)
 * Add the ability to record sound files with phonon to a dock if possible.
 * Save columns hide state, enable hiding of main columns with their children maybe
 * Saving crashes right now
 * Save changes in the multiple choice dock
 * activate all readers/writers
 * Finish porting the word types to use the lesson class and rename the lesson class to container
 * Use the same for the leitner implementation
 * Implement searching again
 * Find a way to select all vocabulary - do we need a root lesson again?
 * Implement Leitner method
 * Update word type and lesson when selecting an entry (?) (Leitner as well?)
 * What about editing multiple entries at the same time? does that work? does it help with the new design?
 * The statistics page is broken. At least reset does not work and there is no tree view for it.

 * Drag and drop for several things:
   - Reorder lessons
   - Move lessons to be child lessons of others
   - Drag entries into lessons/word types/leitner boxes
   - Drag lessons/word types into leitner boxes
   - Drop images from outside
   - Sound

 * Give containers an image tag and display images in the lesson view
 * Check for mem leaks - I bet I introduced some in the lib.

**GENERAL**
 * update the dtd and validate some documents
 * write more unit tests
 * add image tag to lesson class
 * adverbs/adjectives: base form is there already, no need to enter it again!

**BUGS**
 * When sorting columns the entry numbers sometimes are not updated. Either hide the number column (do we need it anyways? or fix that)

Gui
 * shortcut keys are badly assigned, they do not respect the focus
 * Image file open dialog: filter and preview. Maybe restrict to image files?
 * Sound file open dialog: filter and preview
 * Editing of vocabulary should be made easier
 * Navigation (editing vocabulary).
   act as usual spreadsheet application. (especially useful if trying to edit more than 2 columns).
     Enter       -> move down.
     Shift+Enter -> move up.
     Tab         -> move right.
     Shift+Tab   -> move left.
 * When clicking on "Restore native order" arrow in column header remains.
   It should become hidden now.
 * Entry number column - clicking on it should maybe sort entries by
   their numbers, not select all entries. (This was tricky somehow, though I don't remember why)
 * Ctrl+F shortcut for search
 * Improve the search somehow to let the user continue typing instead of blocking (also not trivial?)
 * If the active field stays, it would be easier to use checkboxes
 * Model/view for the main table: include other fields and be more flexible
 * Different icons for Lesson-Select/Add/Deselect/Delete (right click menu)
 * For some languages (with signs like chinese) it would be nice to have different font sizes in the columns
Validator/correction of user answers
 * Seperators need to be implemented with the new corrector class. Possibly giving the user the chance to add more words when entering right answers but not all of them.
 * Analysis of sentences could be improved a lot

General
 * Open/Create file - maybe it makes sense to open/create file in new
   application window, and keep "current" document opened?
 * Warn about overwriting kvtml-1 files

Grammar
 * declination support
   - a class is there
   - reader and writer
   - gui

 * articles are only singular so far
   - reader and writer
   - gui has to be extended

 * adjectives can have a gender and plural

 * tenses - make it possible to change their order and redo the dialog in general

Pronunciation
 * research how entering that could be made easier
 * option to display it along in the practice dialogs
 * is a pronunciation practice desireable? maybe together with sound (write after listening) also very much for chinese I'm told.
