 DO IT:
-------------------

Right click stuff: delete for lessons

Save splitter position, maybe set a more sensible default for it???? -- DONE

Crash when close -> cancel

If I add a new entry it is not displayed in the table!!!!!!!!!
->reload !?!
What happens if current lesson is not in query, but I want to add to it?

Just noticed: we have what's this - need to add hints!!

Get rid of Qt/kde 3 stuff:
[21:44:58] <fregl> pinotree great - tell me what's the best way of getting rid of the kde3 stuff ?? :) any tips where to begin? looking at warnings??
[21:45:16] <pinotree> that one for depreciated method
[21:45:42] <pinotree> and grep Q3 * for a rough find of the Q3 classes
[21:45:53] <pinotree> iirc, in kvoctrain there are just two of them
[21:46:28] <pinotree> common-dialogs/thresholdoptionsbase.ui:      <widget class="Q3ListBox" name="lessonlist" >
[21:46:47] <milliams> fregl: there are scripts in kdesdk i believe
[21:46:52] <pinotree> common-dialogs/pasteoptionsbase.ui:       <widget class="Q3ListBox" name="OrderList" >
[21:47:06] <fregl> sounds like lots of fun
[21:47:08] <pinotree> basically, these are the only two
[21:47:15] <fregl> ok
[21:47:38] <fregl> I'll vote for just kicking out the first one :)
[21:47:46] <fregl> well thanks
[21:47:57] <pinotree> np

<peter> both of those will go away in the near future.

Move Merge to the library so both KVT and KWQ can use it.

Check all query dialogs so that they work properly.

Get rid of copy/paste order stuff.

Review the configuration dialog


--------------------
 NOT SO FAR FUTURE:
--------------------

Lesson list:
-focus via qwidget->setFocus() ??? sometimes a dotted frame is shown upon startup, which does not correspond with the selection.
-I'd like to show the current lesson but someone scrolls it away (maybe the focus?)

Library: Add functions: addLesson, removeLesson, reorderLesson (?)

m_tableView and friends: make columns visible/hide as user wishes. Additional columns for word type and all that seems sensible(?).

Combobox: make it editable with regexp or better space as seperator to search-select lessons
kvttablemodel: make columns hideable, add support for more columns like word type. By default only show original + translations. Are the numbers of the entries significant to the user? maybe better hide them?

Enable drag and drop for lessons and vocab (drag into lesson, change order of lessons).

What happens in the unlikely (and stupid) but possible event, that the user deletes the last lesson that exists? Do we pop up with a new Default lesson?

Icons and artwork seems rather old... maybe ask those oxygen guys?

Allow sorting: is it still necessary? If we have a undo sort function? Otherwise document it.

------------------
 LONG TERM STUFF:
------------------

Tabs or buttons to switch from normal view to query option page (all on one page - this has to be possible. maybe still some special advanced options in the menu, but one page with sane defaults. Maybe a button on it to allow adjusting timeouts for threshholds.) From this page it should be possible to directly start a query.

rename query to test, practice whatever ???

Welcome screen with options: New file (wizzard?), manage old and query/test
AND/OR: Tabs in Main Window allowing allowing a quick switch between table and query option page (which can start the query)

More test possibilities? Like plugins?
-Letter mixup like on ponsline

Make the query/test look better!?! Colorfull? Nice?

Statistics/after test screen? Number of words with status xyz? "Hey, you got 33,33 % right the first time, cool!"?
Also maybe (if desired) a list of words that are especially bad... As to say, hey - these are your problems.

maybe some article handling? I find that I often have the word right but with wrong article. Then it says false and sometimes I change my word, which was right. So a hint like, "great, but wrong article" would sometimes be cool.

Synonyms how??????
