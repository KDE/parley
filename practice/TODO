TODO Practice
-------------

Planning:

 * Define which elements a theme has to contain, optional ones
 * How do we realize layout
   - use a svg with rects for the layout? [probably]
   - use widgets on canvas? does that give useable layouts? [yes, yes]
   - should the entire interface be on the canvas, or only parts?
   - What needs to be included in the main UI? How can we simplify the UI?

 * Define base classes for the theme elements (interface/abstract)
    - Seperate out logic from interface
 * Theme elements
    - What should be themeable? Do we need any invariant elements?
 * Define interaction with parley
    - How will parleypractice be spawned?
    - How much abstraction should be between them?

Doing (in no particular order):
 * Make images and sounds work
 * Set up SVG layouts
 * Make sure resizing the window interacts sensibly with the widgets
 * Clean up the UI / Make it pretty
 * Create the settings dialogs
 * Make parleypractice honor its settings
 * Create the statistical summary dialog
 * Create the basic widgets
 * Recreate various practice modes
 * Create new practice modes
