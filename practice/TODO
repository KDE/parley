TODO Practice
-------------

 * Define which elements a theme has to contain, optional ones
 * How do we realize layout
   - use a svg with rects for the layout?
   - use widgets on canvas? does that give useable layouts??

 * Define base classes for the theme elements (interface/abstract)
 * Implement the theme elements
 * Define interaction with parley - does this stay independent?
